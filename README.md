vim-textobj-blade-directive
===========================

A text object for Laravel's [Blade](https://laravel.com/docs/master/blade)
directives.

![Example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/adriaanzon/assets/master/vim-textobj-blade-directive.gif)

Installation
------------

Depends on [vim-textobj-user](https://github.com/kana/vim-textobj-user) and
[vim-blade](https://github.com/jwalton512/vim-blade).

```vim
Plug 'kana/vim-textobj-user'
Plug 'jwalton512/vim-blade'
Plug 'adriaanzon/vim-textobj-blade-directive'
```

Also requires the matchit.vim plugin to be enabled. You can check if it's
enabled by running `:echo g:loaded_matchit`, it should return `1`.

If it's not enabled yet, you can do so by putting the following in your vimrc:

```vim
runtime macros/matchit.vim
```

Usage
-----

When textobj-blade-directive is installed you will gain two new text objects,
which are triggered by <kbd>a</kbd><kbd>d</kbd> and <kbd>i</kbd><kbd>d</kbd>
respectively. These follow Vim convention, so that <kbd>a</kbd><kbd>d</kbd>
selects _all_ of a Blade directive, and <kbd>i</kbd><kbd>d</kbd> selects the
_inner_ portion of a Blade directive.

### Tips

In the example GIF, the `@if` statement got surrounded with a `@can` statement.
This isn't directly related to this plugin, but it was achieved using the
[vim-surround](https://github.com/tpope/vim-surround) plugin, with the
following configuration in `after/ftplugin/blade.vim`:

```vim
" Use 'd' to surround with a Blade directive.
let b:surround_{char2nr("d")} = "@\1Blade directive: @\1 \r @end\1\r\[( \]\\+.*\r\1"
" Some aliases for convenience.
let b:surround_{char2nr("D")} = b:surround_{char2nr("d")}
let b:surround_{char2nr("@")} = b:surround_{char2nr("d")}
```

Now you can surround anything with a Blade directive. For example, if you
wanted to surround a paragraph, you could select the paragraph with
<kbd>v</kbd><kbd>i</kbd><kbd>p</kbd>, followed by an <kbd>S</kbd> to activate
vim-surround, followed by a <kbd>d</kbd>. This will open a prompt where you may
type your blade directive.

### Limitations

* Operations are done line wise, so this text object doesn't work for
  statements on a single line.

* Some text objects in Vim respond to a count. For example, the
  <kbd>a</kbd><kbd>{</kbd> text object will select _all_ of the current `{}`
  delimited block, but if you prefix it with the number 2 (e.g.
  <kbd>v</kbd><kbd>2</kbd><kbd>i</kbd><kbd>{</kbd>) then it will select all of
  the block that contains the current block. The Blade directive text object
  does not respond in this way if you prefix a count. This is due to a
  limitation in the [textobj-user plugin](https://github.com/kana/vim-textobj-user).

  However, you can achieve a similar effect by repeating the Blade directive
  text-object manually. So if you press <kbd>v</kbd><kbd>a</kbd><kbd>d</kbd> to
  select the current Blade directive, you can expand your selection outwards by
  repeating <kbd>a</kbd><kbd>d</kbd>, or contract your selection inwards by
  repeating <kbd>i</kbd><kbd>d</kbd>.

[vim-textobj-rubyblock](https://github.com/nelstrom/vim-textobj-rubyblock).
This plugin was made by simply changing the search patterns in his plugin.

I also thank Kana Natsuno for providing
[a framework](https://github.com/kana/vim-textobj-user) to build custom text
objects.
